# Wordle Solver

This solver uses a list of 5-letter words plus usage frequency (occurrences per 100 million words - of all lengths - in the source text), derived from [this source](http://www.kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html) to resource guesses that prefer more common words.

## How it works

Basically:

1. Find all the words that match the information so far (the candidate words).
2. For each candidate word, add the word's usage frequency to a tally for each letter. Then we will know the overall most frequently-used letters.
3. For each candidate word, add the precalculated value of its letters to get the value of the word.
4. Use the most valuable word as the next guess.
5. Repeat until done.

There are initially about 30,500 candidate words (not all of these are in the Wordle list but they can be skipped if so). After the first guess, the candidate list is whittled to maximum of 2000 words.

## Usage

Run:
```{bash}
python3 solver.py
```

It will suggest the best word (initially, OATER) and ask for the result. Type 5 characters to indicate the result, such as `.y..Y` then press `ENTER`:

* â¬› = `.`
* ðŸŸ¨ = `y`
* ðŸŸ© = `Y`

If the suggested word isn't in the Wordle word list, type `n` and it will choose the next-best word. Once you type `YYYYY` the guesses will stop.

```
Suggest 'OATER'
Outcome? yY..Y
Filtered down to 31 words, [abcdfghijklmnpqrsuvwxyz][a][abcdfghijklmnopqrsuvwxyz][abcdfghijklmnopqrsuvwxyz][r]
Suggest 'MAJOR'
Outcome? .Y.YY
Filtered down to 23 words, [abcdfghiklnpqrsuvwxyz][a][abcdfghiklnopqrsuvwxyz][o][r]
Suggest 'LABOR'
Outcome? .Y.YY
Filtered down to 16 words, [acdfghiknpqrsuvwxyz][a][acdfghiknopqrsuvwxyz][o][r]
Suggest 'HAZOR'
Outcome? n
Filtered down to 15 words, [acdfghiknpqrsuvwxyz][a][acdfghiknopqrsuvwxyz][o][r]
Suggest 'FAVOR'
Outcome? YYYYY
Jolly good - that took 4 guesses
```

## Potential Improvements

* The word list could be reduced to Wordle's valid word list, which is included in the page source, to save on time guessing invalid words.
* We could probably exclude words that only occur once or twice in 100 million words, since they're unlikely to be chosen as answers. BUT they might be good for discriminating.
* The solver always suggests words that match the information given (ie "hard mode"). Words that don't 100% match may be better for narrowing down large solution spaces, but exactly what the best discriminator is seems expensive to calculate.
